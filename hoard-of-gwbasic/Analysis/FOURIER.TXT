This program is intended to write a Fourier series from a wave shape
that can be read from an oscilloscope trace or from a set of meter
readings.  It is based on approximate methods for finding the area under
a curve.

The wave is considered to be neither odd or even so we expect the 
series to contain both sine and cosine terms.  Since this algorithm
is for half-wave symmetry we look for only odd harmonics.  This
program will generate the first eight terms.

It is also assumed that the waveform begins at x=0, so the first data
ordinate point entered should be at x=0.

It is necessary to enter the ordinates for only ONE HALF CYCLE.

Thirty to forty points will yield a Fourier series with a good fit
to the original waveform.

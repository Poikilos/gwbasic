 Example of installation of game in drive C under \GAMES directory
              INSTALL /I C:\GAMES
 The program will then copy all files to c:\games\startrek.
        /X -- Causes Install to NOT automatically create the 
                 directory STARTREK in addition to the dir-
                 ectory specified when this command is used.
        NOTE:You MUST specify a drive &/or directory with /X.

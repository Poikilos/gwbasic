# Korenvliet

## Synopsis

Korenvliet is a TADS 3 remake of the Korenvliet GW-BASIC adventure (author unknown). This implementation adds room and item descriptions lacking in the original. Some obscure puzzles have been made clear and many atmopsheric items and descriptions were added.

## Installation

This project can be loaded and compiled using the [TADS 3 workbench](http://www.tads.org/tads3.htm). The workbench can compile the code to a TADS story file (.t3) which can be run using a TADS interpreter on many platforms, or straight to a Windows executable.

## Contributors

Everyone is welcome to improve Korenvliet's code so that the adventure can be made better.

## Bugfixes

### February 2017 

* Placing the rubber boat in the brook or lake yielded confusing responses.
* Typos in barn location
* Plateau location showed no exits
* Total score was 7, but 8 points can be scored

As I was writing DOS based BASIC programs over the years I found the need,
(as many programmers who used BASIC did), for general purpose subroutines
that could be used with the programs I was writing. At one time I even
packaged a well documented set of routines for sale. The result of this
work was <A HREF="routines.bas">ROUTINES.BAS</A>.
<p>

It has features that you have seen on many older DOS programs like
shadowed boxes with selectable color combinations. I actually put too
much effort into putting all these features in it, because I reverted
to using (and still use) just a monochrome subset of these routines in
<A HREF="routsmal.bas">ROUTSMAL.BAS</A>. I also continue to make slight
improvements to ROUTSMAL when I have the need.
<p>

I recommend ROUTSMAL over ROUTINES except to learn how to do something
or to copy a routine you need that is not in ROUTINES. Also, the line numbers
between the two are different. <i>Keep in mind that some of the test programs
and other complete programs described on other pages may use some of these
routines in a way that demonstrate them better or better provides a way to
extract them for your uses.</i>
<p>

The subroutine that started it all was <A HREF="editsub.bas">EDITSUB.BAS</A>,
a replacement for BASIC's INPUT statement, and is still useful if you need
something small.
<p>

Note: Some of the programs in the <i>Miscellaneous</i> section use some of
these subroutines <i>or earlier and simpler versions of them</i>. The
assembly language interface subroutine is the only place where it was
necessary to have different commands for GWBASIC and QuickBASIC, and it
is commented.
<p>


ROUTSMAL contains only the following:
<ul>
<li>outline the screen
<li>display centered message
<li>edit a field at row and column
<li>select a file from the current directory
<li>select a file from any directory on the disk
<li>multiple selection menu
<li>point and shoot menu of up to 9 items
<li>scrolling point and shoot menu for >20 and <100 items 
</ul>


ROUTINES contains the following:
<ul>
<li>display and select colors for ROUTINES
<li>outline the screen
<li>erase line
<li>display message at row and column
<li>edit a field at row and column
<li>message and field/date/time/dollar amount
<li>enter or change date
<li>enter or change time
<li>enter dollar amount
<li>wait for any key hit
<li>delay in seconds
<li>delay in seconds or key hit
<li>wait for a function key hit
<li>display and select file names (vertically)
<li>display and select file names (wide)
<li>point and shoot style menu
<li>multiple selection on/off menu
<li>full screen menu with work & prompt areas
<li>erase menu work area
<li>erase menu prompt area
<li>display a bar graph
<li>draw 1 bar for bar graph
<li>create messages with large characters
<li>display messages with large characters
</ul>
<p>


The following require the assembly language interface:
<p>

<ul>
<li>get monitor type
<p>

The following provide access to mouse function calls:
<p>

<ul>
<li>hardware reset and status
<li>show cursor
<li>hide cursor
<li>get button status and mouse position
<li>set cursor position
<li>get button press info
<li>get button release info
<li>set cursor limits
<li>set graphics cursor
<li>set text cursor
<li>read motion counters
<li>set sensitivity and double speed
<li>get driver version, type, IRQ
</ul>

</ul>
<p>

This is the assembly language interface:
<ul>
<li>set up and call assembly language subroutine
<li>load assembly language subroutine
</ul>
<p>

ROUTINES is so large that there is not enough room in the GWBASIC interpreter
to include demo code to show how to use it, so I broke it apart into
files that include parts of ROUTINES and demo code. They are as follows:
<p>

<A HREF="routdemi.bas">ROUTDEMI.BAS</A>, assembly language interface,
mouse support. This is a crude EGA graphics drawing program. (However, a
better graphics program can be found in the graphics program area.)
<p>

<A HREF="routdemf.bas">ROUTDEMF.BAS</A>, file selection. (However, ROUTSMAL
has monochrome file selection routines with more features.)
<p>

<A HREF="routdemd.bas">ROUTDEMD.BAS</A>, display and data entry.
<p>

<A HREF="routdemg.bas">ROUTDEMG.BAS</A>, block graphics, bar charts. All of
these work on monochrome monitors.
<p>

<A HREF="routdemm.bas">ROUTDEMM.BAS</A>, menus and menu selection. "Point and
shoot", toggle lists of items, etc.

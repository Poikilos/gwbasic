Miscellaneous programs, demo's, and snippets, in alpharandomized order

Note: Many of the "graphics" programs or demos were written a long time ago for monchrome monitors, block characters, and low resolution graphics, and are now probably only useful for their instructional value or some of the ideas or methods in them.

DRAWPCX.BAS draw graphics on VGA screen and save as a PCX file, good demo of writing a PCX file, can read monochrome PCX files, (needs to be compiled, will not work in GWBASIC)
DRAWPCXC.BAS like DRAWPCX but can read color PCX files
GEP.BAS keyboard operated graphics program (Etch-A-Sketch style)

MOUSEPOS.BAS display mouse position on a text screen
NUMWORDS.BAS finds number of words in a file
OKI.BAS set options on Okidate printers
PALETTE.BAS demonstrates showing all 4 shades of a color in SCREEN 9
PHONE10.BAS, PHONE7.BAS make words from phone numbers
PRINT39.BAS code 39 bar code label printing for dot matrix printer

SPLIT.BAS split large text file into several smaller ones
SWATCH.BAS shows all the colors available in SCREEN 9
TXBIN.BAS, RXBIN.BAS transmit and receive binary files from serial port
WHATMON.BAS finds out what monitor type is connected
WSCONVRT.BAS convert WordStar files back to regular
SLOWMOUS.BAS reduce the mouse sensitivity
PRINTEST.BAS shows how to test for printer so as not to get errors
SCRNDEMO.BAS demonstrates "SCREEN", "VIEW", and "WINDOW" commands in SCREEN 0

GWBASIC Source Code Libraries of General Purpose Routines

placed in the public domain by Gary Peek 
from Gary Peek's BASIC Source Code Archive
As I was writing DOS based BASIC programs over the years I found the need, (as many programmers who used BASIC did), for general purpose subroutines that could be used with the programs I was writing. At one time I even packaged a well documented set of routines for sale. The result of this work was ROUTINES.BAS.

It has features that you have seen on many older DOS programs like shadowed boxes with selectable color combinations. I actually put too much effort into putting all these features in it, because I reverted to using (and still use) just a monochrome subset of these routines in ROUTSMAL.BAS. I also continue to make slight improvements to ROUTSMAL when I have the need.

I recommend ROUTSMAL over ROUTINES except to learn how to do something or to copy a routine you need that is not in ROUTINES. Also, the line numbers between the two are different. Keep in mind that some of the test programs and other complete programs described on other pages may use some of these routines in a way that demonstrate them better or better provides a way to extract them for your uses.

The subroutine that started it all was EDITSUB.BAS, a replacement for BASIC's INPUT statement, and is still useful if you need something small.

Note: Some of the programs in the Miscellaneous section use some of these subroutines or earlier and simpler versions of them. The assembly language interface subroutine is the only place where it was necessary to have different commands for GWBASIC and QuickBASIC, and it is commented.

ROUTSMAL contains only the following:

outline the screen
display centered message
edit a field at row and column
select a file from the current directory
select a file from any directory on the disk
multiple selection menu
point and shoot menu of up to 9 items
scrolling point and shoot menu for >20 and <100 items
ROUTINES contains the following:
display and select colors for ROUTINES
outline the screen
erase line
display message at row and column
edit a field at row and column
message and field/date/time/dollar amount
enter or change date
enter or change time
enter dollar amount
wait for any key hit
delay in seconds
delay in seconds or key hit
wait for a function key hit
display and select file names (vertically)
display and select file names (wide)
point and shoot style menu
multiple selection on/off menu
full screen menu with work & prompt areas
erase menu work area
erase menu prompt area
display a bar graph
draw 1 bar for bar graph
create messages with large characters
display messages with large characters
The following require the assembly language interface:

get monitor type
The following provide access to mouse function calls:

hardware reset and status
show cursor
hide cursor
get button status and mouse position
set cursor position
get button press info
get button release info
set cursor limits
set graphics cursor
set text cursor
read motion counters
set sensitivity and double speed
get driver version, type, IRQ
This is the assembly language interface:

set up and call assembly language subroutine
load assembly language subroutine
ROUTINES is so large that there is not enough room in the GWBASIC interpreter to include demo code to show how to use it, so I broke it apart into files that include parts of ROUTINES and demo code. They are as follows:

ROUTDEMI.BAS, assembly language interface, mouse support. This is a crude EGA graphics drawing program. (However, a better graphics program can be found in the graphics program area.)

ROUTDEMF.BAS, file selection. (However, ROUTSMAL has monochrome file selection routines with more features.)

ROUTDEMD.BAS, display and data entry.

ROUTDEMG.BAS, block graphics, bar charts. All of these work on monochrome monitors.

ROUTDEMM.BAS, menus and menu selection. "Point and shoot", toggle lists of items, etc.

--DIRECTIONS--

Click, download and unzip the following zip files:

GWBASIC.EXE.zip - the complete GW-BASIC 3.23 ( 60.3K )

GWBASIC_Help.zip - a complete GW-BASIC manual by Microsoft in "help" format with indexes and easy to use format. Many thanks to Tom Cloud!

gw-man.zip - a complete GW-BASIC manual by Microsoft in html files. Thanks to Thomas Shaffner. Click on index 2 after downloading. It is an excellent linked index.

Another manual for GW-BASIC.

COMPILER.zip - a GW-BASIC compiler. Read the "read me" for all the information that I know. It outputs a stand alone exe file when compiled with the /O option and linked.

OptionList.zip - a list of options for the GW-BASIC compiler (BASCOM). Some do not work.

Compiling GW-BASIC -porting GW-BASIC to QuickBasic2.0 ( probably our compiler ).

GWCOM.html - an optional list of commands. 12 Jun 2002 by KindlyRat before the above manual was recieved.

exil- a Linux / GW-BASIC converter.

basictut.zip - an optional tutorial by Castcoly Software. After unzipping click BT1 and BT2 and press "page up" and "page down" to read.

-- HINTS --

GW-BASIC was once the main language used on home computers and is still useful in learning the fundamentals of computer programming and smaller utility programs. It still runs on Microsoft Windows computers thru WindowsXP, though not in a window, but on the black screen used for MS-DOS programming above that will pop up when you click on the GWBASIC icon.

GW-BASIC is an interpreted language which means that it isn't compiled. You type the program in or copy and paste it into a text ( Notepad ) file saved with the name and a .BAS suffix, surrounded by quotation marks. Entering "run" will start the program. GW-BASIC uses line numbers and runs and saves files with a ".BAS" suffix in the same file as the interpreter. You can also run a program by "dragging and dropping" the program on top of the interpreter.

You can find a Users Guide and Reference at any good garage sale or library. Also don't forget to check Amazon.com's used books and I found a "Microsoft GW-BASIC Users Guide and Reference" at Half.com for $0.75! If all else fails I have a list of GW-Basic commands for download above and several tutorials and links to tutorials.

---GWBASIC GAMES---

note: these games are for GW-BASIC, BUT can be "LIST"ed and clipboarded and saved to notepad. Then you can load them into other BASIC languages. You may have to change a few lines.

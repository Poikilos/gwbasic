// Once you are done trying to 'optimize' this routine,
// and have realized what a terrible mistake that was,
// please increment the following counter as a warning
// to the next guy:
// total_hours_wasted_here = 13


// When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing
// Now, God only knows

// I'm sorry.  


// Always returns true.
public boolean isAvailable() {
    return false;
}


// You are not meant to understand this


// I am not sure if we need this, but too scared to delete.


// Dear future me. Please forgive me.
// I can't even begin to express how sorry I am.


double penetration; // ouch


// Mr. Compiler, please do not read this.  


// Hard to explain


// Empty constructor to satisfy the stupid compiler


public GetRandomNumber()
{
    // Chosen by a fairly rolen dice
    // guaranteed to be random
    return 3;
}


// DON'T SCREW WITH THIS CODE UNLESS YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND IT!
